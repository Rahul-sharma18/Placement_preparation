<h3 class="name1">Mayur Jaiswal  </h3>
<p class="pera1">I am placed in TCS, Infosys, Wipro , Indus valley partner, Silver Peak Global. Today I would like to share my success journey about my placement. So it all started in 3rd year when we moved our mindset from college fun to have a serious study as everyone started telling us that soon we will have to sit for placement drive.During starting of 3rd year it was very new and confusing too that how to start for placement and what do we have to prepare and with that fear that whether we will get any placement or not, will any company give us job or not. At that time we were so confused about what to study, then some miracle happened that our college conducted a seminar where we got to know that soon they are making a pilot batch for 3rd year students for an upcoming placement drive. During Success Gateway class i got to know that whatever the thing which i have studied till now in C language was not enough at all, i was having fear of pointer too but as the classes goes on all the problems were getting solved, they guided us very much to how to prepare to clear any company's written drive, they taught us each and every topic which is asked in written exam of any drive. Best thing of joining Success Gateway is that they will make ur data structure strong which will help u to get placed in good companies, they also guided us for sitting in interview and how to tackle those interviewer’s questions and bcoz of that only i got placed in more than one companies so i really want to give this credit to Sachin sir and Vinod sir for all their efforts. Thank You so much sir and guys I will suggest you that you must join success gateway bcoz this will help u to get placed in good company bcoz in starting i was not expecting that i will get placed in at most 1 company also but see now i got more than 3 job offers.</p>

<p class="pera1">It all started when after my 12th,  I was looking for an institute where I can pursue Computer Science Engineering having a world class curriculum along with decent placement opportunities. I found ChandigarhUniversity,  a student of batch 2012-16. I learnt all the trending technologies that were there in the market which helped me to secure 3 offers from the institute i.e. in Wipro Limited, Cognizant Technology Solutions and Tech Mahindra.

    Joined Wipro Limited as an Associate Consultant – SAP ABAP. Worked for 2 years as an effective team player in resolving various issues in Roll-Out. The journey did not stop here, cracked Symbiosis National Aptitude Test – SNAP and currently serving as a part of Placement Advisory Committee at Symbiosis Centre For Information Technology. In addition to it, I did my internship in one of the Big 4’s Consulting firms - KPMG India.
    
    It has been rightly said in order to achieve your future endeavour, it’s very important to lay a very strong foundation. Chandigarh University acted as the foundation that helped me to burn the mid night oil and brought the best out of me. </p>

<h3 class="name2">Vandana Singh</h3>
<p class="pera1">I am placed in IBM ,Infosys ,NTT Data, QA InfoTech, I would like to share my journey toward getting placed .So
     it’s all started when I came to 3rd year of Btech (CSE) when it hit me what next, because till 2nd year we all are more like
      enjoying the college life but when you reach 3rd year and you start witnessing your senior getting placed , coming in formals 
      and that moment you also become more active what’s going on ,so same happen with me. So I started panicking, confusing myself 
      and more on getting worried what to do, what not to do, what I have knowledge about ,to what extent it is enough, how to prepare
       and lots and lots of questions and doubts and seriously at that point of time I was really in a need of clear and effective guidance .
       And guess what our Training and placement cell get us a way. And we came to know about the process to get in the batch and there only the competition begin,
         since the batch will be of 75 and we all are 360 students (CSE + IT) . So we all get excited and surround ourself with fear of losing the
          opportunity. I prepared hard for getting selected for this amazing batch where my all doubts can be cleared and I can get a guided
           path toward my career. I appeared for the test and it’s level was moderate and in the evening we got the message of selection and
            Guess what Yesssss … I was in.Then very next day we were introduced to batch of 75 and our respective mentors Sachin Sir and 
            Vinod sir and classes begin from very basic C and I realized that what I was had knowledge of was not at all enough. They cover C, Data Structure , DBMS, Aptitude, Algorithms, competitive coding, Dynamic
              programming, HR questions deeply. And along with this the best thing about our mentor is their words of guidance ,motivation 
              and pushing students that really help a lot. </div><br><br>

<p class="pera1">It was an amazing and memorable experience that I gained while studying with Success GATEway. May be it was just a month 
    training specially for placement drives at college, which included mainly the basic concepts of C, OS, DAA, DS, DBMS, Puzzle solving.
     They also arranged face to face interview sessions with IITians and several other from IT sector for all of us which was overall a 
     great experience being a fresher. Even they keeps on clarifying your doubts time to time, be it any. The best thing about this 
     coaching is that you will always feel motivated, focus will be towards your aim and they will make you the most confident aspirant 
     for any competition. The secret of it's success are the faculties, they are among the best teachers. Even the modules of success 
     GATEway are very informative as there is lot to practice and you get the understanding of practical knowledge. I really feel satisfied
      with my decision that I chose to join this coaching at that time because everything was covered as required for a placement in such a 
      small span of time with great accuracy. I got placed in the very first company that came to my college campus- TATA Consultancy Services.
       And many of my friends who were students of this coaching got placed in good IT companies and also, few cleared GATE exam with good ranks 
       and are doing great in their lives. And even in present whenever we need suggestions for our career, they are for sure the best ones to 
       concern.They always 
    listen to your queries and try to give the best solution possible. Thank you Success GATEway for a wonderful learning experience.
     I really appreciate all the efforts and will always need your blessings and support in my life.</div><br><br>
